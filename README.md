# DAOs by example

Data sets and other materials for the "DAOs by example" paper.

To suggest changes and comment on the data set, please do so in [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vaOZT6HOd5BLRGhVRRvmY8AvPA6CMT9ssHTdRxWpvyE/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

To fork the data set, try adding a new sheet in the spreadsheet so that others can see your work. PLEASE RETAIN THE ID NUMBERING WHEN CHANGING EXAMPLES, i.e. if you want to edit an example like "A Facebook group", don't edit example #8, create a new record. 

If/when this becomes unmanageable, we will switch over to GitHub and CSVs.
